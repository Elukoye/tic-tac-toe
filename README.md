# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
# [Collaborative Project]
In this project, the student builds a Tic Tac Toe game. The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes and access to their attributes.

# Project specific
1.Create 2 main directories: lib - for the game logic bin - with the executable file called main.rb.
main.rb file should be responsible for user interaction. This is the only one place where puts and get.chomp can be used.
2.Think how you can encapsulate diffrent parts of game logic in classes. Do not create one class for everything.
3.Read about DRY rule and use it.
4.Think about the diffrence between attr_readers/attr_writers and atrr_acessors. Use atrr_acessors only if you really need it.
5.Remember about single responsibility rule. Always.
